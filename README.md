## Day 0

The first day starts with some initial setup and a couple of challenges to be performed during the following week.

Students need to install:

1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - not strictly needed, but better to have all the same browser.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - the editor we will use. Alternatives are fine, but it's better to use all the same editor.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - it would be useful to learn some Git so we can share our portfolios with the world.
4. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - quite useful to continue learning JavaScript without the need for a browser.
5. [Slack](https://slack.com/) - our communication platform of choice.
