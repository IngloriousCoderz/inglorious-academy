## Module 0

The first module starts with some initial setup and a couple of challenges to be performed during the following week.

Students need to install:

1. [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - not strictly needed, but better to have all the same browser.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - the editor we will use. Alternatives are fine, but it's better to use all the same editor.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - it would be useful to learn some Git so we can share our portfolios with the world.
4. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - quite useful to continue learning JavaScript without the need for a browser.
5. [Slack](https://slack.com/) - our communication platform of choice.

Also the first homework in this early stage is about playing two games:

1. [Blockly Games](https://blockly.games/) - a logic puzzle game that reminds a lot of how coders think. Students can just do Mazes 1 to 9, or try the hard 10th level, and then maybe try out other games too.
2. [Typing.io](https://typing.io/) - a typing game that lets students improve their speed and accuracy when typing code. The two games we're insterested here are "JavaScript jQuery" and "Less Bootstrap", since we are mainly going to do HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
